## Snake Game üêç

This is my first Python project : a simple Snake Game built using the `turtle` module. In this game, players control a snake to eat food, which makes the snake grow in length. The objective is to keep the snake from colliding with the walls or itself while continuing to grow longer with each food item eaten.

### Features:
- Classic Snake Game mechanics
- Smooth movement and food generation
- Score tracking
- Save highscore
- Game over on self-collision or hitting walls

### Requirements:
- Python 3(latest version)
- `turtle` module
- `random` module
- `time` module

### How to Run:
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies using `pip install PythonTurtle`
3. Run the game with `python snake_game.py`
